---
I am a final-year statistics student at Rajshahi College with a strong interest in data science and its practical applications. I serve as the Joint Secretary of the Statistical Pioneer Club, where I actively engage in academic and collaborative activities related to statistics.

I focus on applying my statistical knowledge in a sustainable way to solve real-world business problems. I have experience working with SQL, Python, and machine learning algorithms, and I enjoy exploring different statistical methods for data wrangling and analysis. I am particularly interested in working with real-world data and applying statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights.

I am also preparing for the IELTS exam to expand my opportunities for studying abroad after my BSc. I am passionate about making statistics more accessible, and I love collaborating with others to learn and grow.

In my free time, I read about statistics, data science, and personal development. I also enjoy working out and exploring new ways to enhance my skills.
