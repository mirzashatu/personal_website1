Iâ€™m a statistics student at Rajshahi College with a strong passion for data science. I enjoy working with data, applying statistical methods, and exploring machine learning to solve real-world problems.

In my spare time, I enhance my data science skills and contribute to the Statistical Pioneer Club as the Joint Secretary.
